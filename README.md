## Course Description

This course is designed to teach things that will make a Purdue CS student's life easier.

It was created by [Tyler Hoffman](https://github.com/tyhoff) as part of the Purdue Undergrad Student Board (USB).
It continues to be run by USB and is therefore entirely student-led.

### Labs

Labs are mandatory and they will be over topics taught in the previous week's lecture.

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/lab1) - Introduction to CS190
* [Lab 2](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/lab2) - What Does the _____ Say?
* [Lab 3](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/lab3) - The Doctor Exposed
* [Lab 4](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/lab4) - My New Shell
* [Lab 5](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/lab5) - Basics of Git Part 1: Local Git
* [Lab 6](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/lab6) - Basics of Git Part 2: Remotes and Github

### Quizzes

~~There will be a new quiz posted every two weeks on blackboard. We will remind you in class, but its your responsibility to stay on top of these and watch for new quizzes.~~

Quizzes turned out to be pretty ineffective and mostly busywork, so we only had 2 quizzes. These will still be taken into account for grading. If you missed one of these, then that will still be minus one point.

### Grading

This is a pass/fail class. You will fail if you miss more than 3 points during the semester.

You get a point for every lecture, lab, and quiz.

This, in effect, means that you can miss one lecture, one lab, and one quiz and still pass.

You miss a point for each lecture/lab you don't attend and one for each quiz you miss.
