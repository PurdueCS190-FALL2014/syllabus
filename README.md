## Course Description

This course is designed to teach things that will make a Purdue CS student's life easier.

It was created by [Tyler Hoffman](https://github.com/tyhoff) as part of the Purdue Undergrad Student Board (USB).
It continues to be run by USB and is therefore entirely student-led.

### Course Topics

* Navigating the terminal
* Shell configuration
* Debugging
* Git
* Vim

### Quizzes

There will be a new quiz posted every two weeks on blackboard. We will remind you in class, but its your responsibility to stay on top of these and watch for new quizzes.

### Labs

Labs are mandatory and they will be over topics taught in the previous week's lecture.

### Grading

This is a pass/fail class. You will fail if you miss more than 3 points during the semester.

You get a point for every lecture, lab, and quiz.

This, in effect, means that you can miss one lecture, one lab, and one quiz and still pass.

You miss a point for each lecture/lab you don't attend and one for each quiz you miss.

For any questions on this, contact [Scott](mailto:sopell@purdue.edu) or [Kirby](mailto:kirby@purdue.edu) directly.
